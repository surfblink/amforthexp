I2C Generic
===========

The basic low-level words provide a rather raw access to the
I2C bus and its devices. Since the bus has some standard 
actions, which are always the same, some combinations are useful
factors.

``i2c.begin`` ( addr -- )
  start a I2C communication with the device addr. This involves sending
  the start condition and the address with the write bit cleared.

  In addition, the variable i2c.current gets the addr information to
  be available for user applications.

``i2c.begin-read`` ( addr -- )
  start a I2C *read* communication with the device at addr. This means
  that the device address is used with the read bit *set*.

``i2c.end`` ( -- )
  The communication ends with sending the I2C stop condition and the 
  bus is released. The variable ``i2c.current`` is cleared.

With these commands an I2C transaction becomes

.. code-block:: forth

   i2c.hw.id i2c.begin .... i2c.end

Inside the begin/end scope, the basic I2C routines for
writing (``i2c.tx``) and reading can be used. They work
with the device selected with ``i2c.begin``.

Most I2C devices use rather small data packets they
exchange with the host. It's not uncommon to place the
data on the data stack instead of providing a RAM buffer.

For these tasks the following words are provided. They
to work within the begin/end scope described above.

``i2c.c@`` ( addr -- c )
  Start a bus cycle and read one byte from the device.
  Afterwards release the bus.

``i2c.c!`` ( c addr -- )
  Start a bus cycle and write one byte to the device.
  Afterwards release the bus.

``i2c.n!`` ( x_n .. x_1 n addr -- )
  Start a bus cycle and send n bytes to the device. Afterwards
  the STOP condition is sent and the bus is released.

``i2c.n@`` ( n addr -- x_n .. x_1 )
  Start a bus cycle and receive n bytes from the
  device. To acomplish that, a start is triggered with
  the read bit of the addr set. Afterwards the STOP condition is
  sent and the bus is released.

``i2c.m!n@`` ( n xm .. x1 m addr -- x1 .. xn )
  A combination of the two above. It creates the I2C transaction
  scope and sends m bytes to the device. Afterwards the data
  transfer direction is switched by sending a repeated start
  and n bytes are read from the device. Finally the STOP condition is
  sent and the bus is released.

Example - Port Expander
------------------------

This example communicates with an I2C port expander
PCF8574(a). The I2C address is usually between $30 and $3f.

Communication is not time critical, so the slow speed standard
initialization is sufficient. To chack whether the device is
present and works properly, an I2C bus scan is made first

.. code-block:: console

   (ATmega1280)> i2c.init.default 
    ok
   (ATmega1280)> i2c.detect 
         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F
    0:                       -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
   10:  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
   20:  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 27 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
   30:  30 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 3D -- --
   40:  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
   50:  50 51 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
   60:  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
   70:  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --                        
    ok
   (ATmega1280)>

A modification uses the value design pattern. With that,
a new value is created that automatically fetches the
data from the device when called and stores the new bit
pattern with ``TO``:

.. code-block:: forth

   #require value.frt
   #require quotations.frt

   : i2c.cvalue ( n addr hwid -- )
     (value)
     dup , \ store the hwid
     [: dup @i ( hwid) i2c.c@ ;] ,
     [: dup @i ( hwid) i2c.c! ;] ,
     i2c.pe.c!  \ store inital data
   ;

Use it as follows

.. code-block:: forth

   > $ff $3d i2c.cvalue keys ( sets all bits to HIGH)
   ok
   > $00 to keys ( set all bits to LOW )
   ok
   > keys $01 and ( if key 1 is pressed )


Big Data
--------

Big data means that a device sends or receives more data
than the data stack can hold. In this case, the ``i2c.begin``
and ``i2c.end`` in combination with the low level ``i2c.tx``, 
``i2c.rx`` etc should be used. One example is the I2C EEPROM 
block driver. It transfers 512 bytes in one transaction and uses
a RAM buffer to actually hold the data.
