The AVR8 platform cover the Atmega microcontrollers
from Atmel. They are 8-bit systems. Amforth emulates
a 16-bit forth on them.


Bootloader Support
------------------

Most AVR8 bootloaders will not work with amforth since they do
not provide an application programming interface to rewrite a
single flash cell. The default setup will thus replace any
bootloader found with some core routines. 

It is possible to change the word
:command:`!i` to use an API and work
with existing bootloaders. :command:`!i`
is a deferred word that can be re-targeted
to more advanced words that may do address range
checks, write success checks or simply turn
on/off LEDs to visualize the flash programming.

Fuses
-----

Amforth uses the self programming feature of the ATmega
micro controllers to work with the dictionary. It is ok to use the
factory default settings plus the changes for the oscillator
settings. It is recommended to use a higher CPU frequency to meet
the timing requirements of the serial terminal.

Fuses are the main cause for problems with the flash write operations.
If the !i operation fails, make sure that the code for
it is within the boot loader section. It is recommended to make the
bootloader section as large as the NRWW section, otherwise the basic
machine instruction spm may fail silently and the controller becomes
unresponsive.

CPU -- Forth VM Mapping
-----------------------

The Forth VM has a few registers that need to be mapped to the
microcontroller registers. The mapping has been extended over time
and may cover all available registers. The actual coverage depends
on the amount of additional packages. The default settings are shown
in the table :ref:`avr8_register_mappings`.

+------------------------------+--------------------+

In addition the register pair R0:R1 is used internally e.g. to
hold the the result of multiply operations. The register pair R2:R3
is used as the zero value in many words. These registers must never
be changed.

The registers from R10 to R13 are currently unused, but may be
used for the VM extended registers X and Y sometimes. The
registers R14 to R21 are used as temporary registers and can be used
freely within one module as temp0 to temp7.

The forth core uses the
T Flag in the machine status register SREG for signalling
an interrupt. Any other code must not change that bit.


Stacks
------

Data Stack
..........

The data stack uses the CPU register pair :command:`YH:YL` as its data
pointer. The Top-Of-Stack element (TOS) is in a register pair.
Compared to a straight forward implementation this approach saves
code space and gives higher execution speed (approx 10-20%). Saving even
more stack elements does not really provide a greater benefit (much more
code and only little speed enhancements).

The data stack starts at a configurable distance
below the return stack (RAMEND) and grows
downward.

Return Stack
............

The Return Stack is the hardware stack of the
controller. It is managed with push/pop
assembler instructions. The default return stack
starts at RAMEND and grows downward.

Interrupts
----------

Amforth routes the low level interrupts into the
forth inner interpreter. The inner interpreter
switches the execution to a predefined word if an
interrupt occurs. When that word finishes execution,
the interrupted word is continued. The interrupt
handlers are completely normal forth colon words
without any stack effect. They do not get interrupted
themselves.

The processing of interrupts takes place in two steps:
The first one is the low level part.
It is called whenever an interrupt occurs. The code
is the same for all interrupts. It takes the number
of the interrupt from its vector address and stores
this in a CPU register. Then  returns with :command:`RET`.

The second step does the inner interpreter.
It checks whether the CPU register dedicated for
interrupt handling has a non-NULL content. If so it 
switches to interrupt handling at forth level. This 
approach has a penalty of 2 CPU cycles for checking 
and skipping the branch instruction to the isr forth 
code if no interrupt occurred.

If an interrupt is detected, the forth VM clears the
register and continues with the word :command:`ISR-EXEC`. 
This word reads the currently active interrupt number and calls
the associated execution token.  When this word is finished,
the word :command:`ISR-END` is called. This word clears
the interrupt flag for the controller (:command:`RETI`).

This interrupt processing has two advantages: There are
no lost interrupts (the controller itself disables interrupts
within interrupts and re-transmits newly discovered interrupts
afterwards) and it is possible to use standard forth words
to deal with any kind of interrupts.

Interrupts from some hardware sources (e.g. the usart)
need to be cleared from the Interrupt Service Routine.
If this is not done within the ISR, the interrupt
is re-triggered immediately after the ISR returned control.

The downside is a relatively long latency since the the
forth VM has to be synchronized with the interrupt handling
code in order to use normal colon words as ISR. This penalty
is usually small since only words in assembly can cause the
delay, most notably the word :command:`1ms`.

.. digraph:: InnerInterpreter

   "COLD" -> "Execute Word"
   "Execute Word" -> "ISR Register Empty?";
   "ISR Register Empty?" -> "Clear ISR Register" [label="Yes"];
   "ISR Register Empty?" -> "Get Next XT" [label="No"];
   "Get Next XT" -> "Execute Word";
   "Clear ISR Register" -> "Next XT is ISR_EXEC";
   "Next XT is ISR_EXEC" -> "Execute Word";

.. seealso:: :ref:`Interrupt Service Routine`
   :ref:`Interrupt Critical Section`

Dictionary Management
---------------------

The dictionary can be seen from several points of view. One is
the split into two memory regions: NRWW and RWW flash. This is
the hardware view. NRWW flash cannot be read during a flash write
operation, NRWW means Non-Read-While-Write. This makes it impossible
to change there anything at runtime. On the other hand is this the place,
where code resides that can change the RWW (Read-While-Write) part of the
flash. For AmForth, the command :command:`!i` does this work: It changes
a single flash cell in the RWW section of the flash. This command hides
all actions that are necessary to achieve this.

The NRWW section is usually large enough to hold the interpreter core
and most (if not all) words coded in assembly (not to be confused with
the words that are hand-assembled into a execution token list) too.
Having all of them within a rather small memory region makes it possible
to use the short-ranged and fast relative jumps instead of slower
full-range jumps necessary for RWW entries.

Another point of view to the dictionary is the memory allocation. The key for it
is the dictionary pointer :command:`dp`. It is a EEPROM based VALUE that stores the
address of the first unused flash cell. With this pointer it is easy to allocate
or free flash space at the end of the allocated area. It is not possible to maintain
"holes" in the address range. To append a single number to the dictionary,
the command :command:`,` is used. It writes the data and increases the DP
pointer accordingly:

.. code-block:: forth

   \ ( n -- )
   : , dp !i dp 1+ to dp ;

To free a flash region, the DP pointer can be set to any value, but a lot
of care has to be taken, that all other system data is still consistent
with it.

The next view point to the dictionary are the wordlists. A wordlist
is a single linked, searchable list of entries. All wordlists create the forth
dictionary. A wordlist is identified by its ``wid``, an EEPROM address, that
contains the address of the first entry. The entries themselves contain a
pointer to the next entry or ZERO to indicate End-Of-List. When a new entry
is added to a list it will be the first one of this wordlist afterwards.

A new wordlist is easily created: Simply reserve an EEPROM cell and
initialize its content with 0:

.. code-block:: forth

   : wordlist ( -- wid )
       ehere 0 over !e
       dup cell+ to ehere ;

This ``wid`` is used to create new entries. The basic procedure to do it
is :command:`create`:

.. code-block:: forth

   : create ( "name" -- )
     (create) reveal
     postpone (constant) ;

:command:`(create)` parses the current source to get a space delimited string.
The next step is to determine, into which wordlists the new entry will be placed
and finally, the new entry is created, but it is still invisible:

.. code-block:: forth

  : (create) ( -- )
      parse-name wlscope
      dup newest cell+ ! \ keep the wid
      header newest !    \ keep the nt
  ;

The :command:`header` command starts a new dictionary entry. The first action is
to copy the string from RAM to the flash. The second task is to create the link
for the wordlist management

.. code-block:: forth

   : header ( addr len wid -- NT )
    dp >r
    \ copy the string from RAM to flash
    r> @e ,
    \ minor housekeeping
   ;

:command:`smudge` is the address of a 4 byte RAM location, that buffers the access information.
Why not not all words are immediately visible  is something, that the forth standard
requires. The command :command:`reveal` un-hides the new entry by adjusting the content
of the wordlist identifier to the address of the new entry:

.. code-block:: forth

  : reveal ( -- )
     newest cell+ @ ?dup if \ check if valid data
     newest  @ swap !e      \ update the head of wordlist
     0 newest cell+ !       \ invalidate
     then ;

The command :command:`wlscope` can be used to change the wordlist that
gets the new entry. It is a deferred word that defaults to
:command:`get-current`.

The last command :command:`postpone (constant)` writes the runtime
action, the execution token (XT) into the newly created word. The XT
is the address of executable machine code that the forth inner interpreter
calls (see :ref:`Inner Interpreter`). The machine code for :command:`(constant)`
puts the address of the flash cell that follows the XT on the data stack.

Word Lists and Environment Queries
----------------------------------

Word lists and environment queries are implemented using the
same structure. The word list identifier is
a EEPROM address that holds the name field address of the
first word in the word list.

Environment queries are normal colon words. They are called within
:command:`environment?` and leave there results at the data
stack.

:command:`find-name` (und :command:`find` for counted strings)
uses an array of word list identifiers to search for the word.
This list can be accessed with :command:`get-order` as well.

Wordlist Header
...............

Wordlists are implemented as a single linked list. The list entry
consists of 4 elements:

* Name Field (NF) (variable length, at least 2 flash cells).
* Link Field (LF) (1 flash cell), points to the NFA of the
  next element.
* Execution Token (XT) (1 flash cell)
* Parameter Field (Body) (variable length)

The wording is some mixture of old style fig-forth and
the more modern variants. The order makes it possible
to implement the list iterators (:command:`search-wordlist`
and :command:`show-wordlist`) is a straight forward way.

The name field itself is a structure containing the flags,
the length information in the first flash cell
and the characters of the word name in a packed format afterwards.

The anchor of any wordlist points to the name field address of the
first element. The last element has a zero link field content. The
lists are created from lower addresses to higher ones, the links go
from higher addresses backwards to lower ones.

Memories
--------

Flash
.....

The flash memory is divided into 4 sections. The
first section, starting at address 0, contains the
interrupt vector table for the low level interrupt
handling and a character string with the name of the
controller in plain text.

The 2nd section contains the low level interrupt
handling routines. The interrupt handler is very
closely tied to the inner interpreter. It is located
near the first section to use the faster relative
jump instructions.

The 3rd section is the first part of the dictionary.
Nearly all colon words are located here. New words
are appended to this section. This section is filled
with FFFF cells when flashing the controller
initially. The current write pointer is the DP
pointer.

The last section is identical to the boot loader
section of the ATmegas. It is also known as the NRWW
area. Here is the heart of amforth: The inner
interpreter and most of the words coded in assembly
language.

FLASH Structure Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _flashstructure:

.. figure:: images/flash-structure.*
   :width: 50%

   Default Flash Structure

The reason for this split is a technical one: to
work with a dictionary in flash the controller needs
to write to the flash. The ATmega architecture
provides a mechanism called self-programming by
using a special instruction and a rather complex
algorithm. This instruction only works in the boot
loader/NRWW section. amforth uses this instruction
in the word I!. Due to the fact that the self
programming is a lot more then only a simple
instruction, amforth needs most of the forth core
system to achieve it. A side effect is that amforth
cannot co-exist with classic boot loaders. If a
particular boot loader provides an API to enable
applications to call the flash write operation,
amforth can be restructured to use it. Currently
only very few and seldom used boot loaders exist that
enable this feature.

Atmegas can have more than 64 KB Flash. This
requires more than a 16 bit address, which is more
than the cell size. For one type of those bigger
atmegas there will be an solution with 16 bit cell
size: Atmega128 Controllers. They can use the whole
address range with an interpretation trick: The flash
addresses are in fact not byte addresses but word
addresses. Since amforth does not deal with bytes
but cells it is possible to use the whole address
range with a 16 bit cell. The Atmegas with 128
KBytes Flash operate slightly slower since the
address interpretation needs more code to access the
flash (both read and write). The source code uses
assembly macros to hide the differences.

An alternative approach to place the elements in the flash shows picture
. Here all code goes into the RWW section. This layout definitely needs a
routine in the NRWW section that provides a cell level flash write functionality.
The usual boot loaders do not have such an runtime accessible API, only the
DFU boot loader from atmel found on some USB enabled controllers does.

Alternative FLASH Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _flash2structure:

.. figure:: images/flash2-structure.*
   :width: 50%

   Alternative Flash Structure

The unused flash area beyond 0x1FFFF is not directly accessible for amforth.
It could be used as a block device.

Flash Write
...........

The word performing the actual flash write
operation is :command:`I!`
(i-store). This word takes the value and the
address of a single cell to be written to flash
from the data stack. The address is a word
address, not a byte address!

The flash write strategy follows Atmel's
appnotes. The first step is turning off all
interrupts. Then the affected flash page is read
into the flash page buffer. While doing the
copying a check is performed whether a flash
erase cycle is needed. The flash erase can be
avoided if no bit is turned from 0 to 1. Only if
a bit is switched from 0 to 1 must a flash page
erase operation be done. In the fourth step the
new flash data is written and the flash is set
back to normal operation and the interrupt flag
is restored. The whole process takes a few
milliseconds.

This write strategy ensures that the flash has
minimal flash erase cycles while extending the
dictionary. In addition it keeps the forth
system simple since it does not need to deal
with page sizes or RAM based buffers for
dictionary operations.

EEPROM
------

The built-in EEPROM contains vital dictionary
pointer and other persistent data. They need only a
few EEPROM cells. The remaining space is available
for user programs. The easiest way to use the EEPROM 
is a :command:`VALUE`. There intended design
pattern (read often, write seldom) is like that for
the typical EEPROM usage. More information about
values can be found in the recipe :ref:`Values`.

Another use for EEPROM cells is to hold execution
tokens. The default system uses this for the turnkey
vector. This is an EEPROM variable that reads and
executes the XT at runtime. It is based on the
DEFER/IS standard. To define a deferred word in the
EEPROM use the Edefer definition word. The standard
word IS is used to put a new XT into it.

Low level space management is done through the the
EHERE variable. This is not a forth value but a EEPROM
based variable. To read the current value an
:command:`@e` operation must be used, changes are written
back with :command:`!e`. It contains the highest EEPROM address
currently allocated. The name is based on the DP variable,
which points to the highest dictionary address.

RAM
---

The RAM address space is divided into three
sections: the first 32 addresses are the CPU
registers. Above come the IO registers and extended
IO registers and finally the RAM itself.

amforth needs very little RAM space for its
internal data structures. The biggest part are the
buffers for the terminal IO. In general RAM is managed
with the words :command:`VARIABLE` and
:command:`ALLOT`.

Forth defines a few transient buffer regions for various purposes.
The most important is PAD, the scratch buffer. It is located 100 bytes
above the current HERE and goes to upper addresses. The Pictured Numeric
Output is just at PAD and grows downward. The word WORD uses the area above
HERE as it's buffer to store the just recognized word from SOURCE.

.. _ramfigure:

.. figure:: images/ram-structure.*
   :width: 50%

   Ram Structure

:ref:`ramfigure` shows an RAM layout that can be used on systems
without external RAM. All elements are located within the internal
memory pool.

.. _ram2figure:

.. figure:: images/ram2-structure.*
   :width: 50%

   Alternative RAM Structure

Another layout, that makes the external RAM easily available is shown in
:ref:`ram2figure`. Here are the stacks at the beginning of the internal RAM and the
data space region. All other buffers grow directly into the external data space. From
an application point of view there is not difference but a speed penalty when
working with external RAM instead of internal.


With amforth all three sections can be accessed
using their RAM addresses. That makes it quite easy
to work with words like :command:`C@`. The word :command:`!`
implements a LSB byte order: The lower part of the
cell is stored at the lower address.

For the RAM there is the word :command:`Rdefer`
which defines a deferred word, placed in RAM. As a
special case there is the word :command:`Udefer`
, which sets up a deferred word in the user area. To
put an XT into them the word :command:`IS`
is used. This word is smart enough to distinguish
between the various Xdefer definitions.
