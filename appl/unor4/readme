# Development

## Required Tools
* Arm GNU Toolchain https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads
* GDB debugger
* OpenOCD - GDB server for on chip debugging
* BOSSAC - board uploader (SAM-BA protocol)
* Golang (if you need to build the touch1200bps binary, used to put the board into bootloader mode)
* some sort of serial i/o tool, e.g. [tio](https://github.com/tio/tio)

## Make commands
* `make` builds everything and generates various listing files in ./build/
* `make upload` rebuilds and uploads to the board
* `make ocd` starts OpenOCD connected to the configured USB port
* `make gdb` starts GDB with Forth TUI and connects it to running OpenOCD server
See Makefile for more details on how to program and debug this port.

To connect to Forth running on the board start your serial monitor in 8N1 mode at 115200 bps.
